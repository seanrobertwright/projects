<!--
  This test simulates a UI5 usage with the following special requirements:
  - jQuery is already loaded by the embedding page, so one of the sap-ui-core files without jQuery is used
  - SAPUI5 is loaded dynamically without a script tag, so the resource root cannot be determined from it
  - modules are also loaded from a different location which must be configured

  This test was originally motivated by the PegasusEnvironment, hence its name.
