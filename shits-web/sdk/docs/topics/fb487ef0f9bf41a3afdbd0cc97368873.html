<p class="p">OPA <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> parameter is available as of version 1.48. It is a good
practice to enable it in your tests. By default, it is not enabled in order to keep
old tests running.</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> synchronizes test execution with the app. No interactions are
attempted while the app is performing asynchronous work. This increases the
probability that OPA statements succeed as they are only executed when the app is
ready to respond.</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> is used:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__ul_rlg_rxj_wbb">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">When you retrieve a control with the intent to perform an action on it</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">For every control search, when you explicitly set <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp>
to <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> is applied before searching for a control, which means before OPA
check functions and matchers. If there is no work to await, the controls are
retrieved, then actions are executed on them and lastly the success function is
called. If there is still pending work, matchers, actions, and success function are
skipped and OPA retries the check until it succeeds or a timeout is reached.</p>
<p class="p">Success functions are only called when controls are found, their state is valid and the app is
responsive. We recommend that you use actions rather than the success function when
interacting with a control. This ensures that the interaction is performed properly
and the app is in a state that allows the interaction to be executed.</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> covers several types of asynchronous work:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__ul_qnb_5yj_wbb">
<li class="li">Delayed work set with timeout and immediate</li>
<li class="li">XHR requests created using XMLHttpRequests and sinon.FakeXMLHttpRequests</li>
<li class="li">Native promises created with <samp class="ph codeph">resolve</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">all</samp>,
<samp class="ph codeph">race</samp>, and <samp class="ph codeph">reject</samp> functions</li>
<li class="li">UI navigation of parent containers</li>
<li class="li">UIArea rerendering</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Enabling <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> ensures that the controls and their parents are
visible, enabled and not busy and also that the controls are not hidden behind
static elements, such as dialogs.</p>
<p class="p">If your app has ongoing asynchronous work when the OPA timeout is reached, the test fails. The
test failure message includes details of the last detected work before the timeout.
This type of OPA timeouts is usually caused by test instability. When writing a huge
set of tests and executing them frequently, you might notice some tests that fail
sporadically. Setting <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp> should
stabilize most of these tests.</p>
<p class="p">If you decide to follow the best practices and to enable <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp>, we
recommend that you do it only once in your code, near the starting point of your
tests. You can then disable it per <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statement where needed.
This will help you to avoid confusion when debugging test failures.</p>
<p class="p">Example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">// in QUnit start page, before all OPA tests
Opa5.extendConfig({
    autoWait: true
});
// in an OPA test
oOpa.waitFor({
    id: &quot;myControlID&quot;,
    success: function (oControl) {
        Opa5.assert.ok(!oControl.getBusy(), &quot;My control was not busy&quot;);
    }
});
// and then in a special waitFor case which requires a control to be non-interactable
oOpa.waitFor({
    autoWait: false,
    id: &quot;myControlID&quot;,
    success: function (oControl) {
        // now you can explicitly check for some blocking condition
        Opa5.assert.ok(oControl.getBusy(), &quot;My control was busy&quot;);
    }
})</pre>
<p class="p">If you decide to start using <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> in your existing tests, the easiest way
to migrate is to extend OPA config by enabling <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp>, run the
tests to see if any <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statements timeout and then disable
<samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> specifically for them.</p>
</section></div>
<div class="section" id="loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__section_efn_nnn_2cb"><section class="section" type="autoWait and App Startup"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> and App Startup</h2>

<p class="p">Usually, there is a lot of time-consuming work done on app startup which can make the
entire app noninteractive for a long time.</p>
<p class="p">To ensure that OPA doesn&apos;t timeout before the app is fully loaded, the timeout for
<samp class="ph codeph">iStartMyAppInAFrame</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">iStartMyUIComponent</samp> is
increased to the default of 80 seconds.</p>
<p class="p">Despite the increase, there are still some tests that timeout. The timeout usually
occurs during the first test step, which can be misleading regarding the actual
cause of failure. <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> is recommended in such cases but it is
disabled during startup to prevent issues with module loading during app launcher
initialization.</p>
<p class="p">As of version 1.54, the optional use of <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> after launcher
initialization is allowed to make sure that the app is loaded before the first test
step. It is disabled by default for backward compatibility as some tests check for
busy indicators on app start. You can use the option with both app launchers, for
example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">Given.iStartMyAppInAFrame({
    source: &quot;applicationUnderTest/index.html&quot;,
    autoWait: true
});</pre>
</section></div>
<div class="section" id="loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__section_ozc_m43_1gb"><section class="section" type="AutoWait and Overflow Toolbars"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;"><samp class="ph codeph">AutoWait</samp> and Overflow Toolbars</h2>

<p class="p">Under some specific circumstances, the <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> is not waiting
enough time and the next interaction happens before the awaited controls are fully
rendered. This problem is particularly visible with overflow toolbars as the
interaction with buttons in the toolbar happens before it is completely open and the
included buttons are not yet ready, meaning that the interactions are lost.</p>
<p class="p">The root cause is a specific behavior in OPA polling when a control is found on first
check. In this case, the next check() is synchronous, for example, it is executed
immediately and not on the next poll interval. The problem with this implementation
is that the synchronous check prevents the detection of subsequent flows started by
the previous interaction. As a result, the synchronization is premature as it
happens before the interaction is fully processed and before the UI is completely
rendered.</p>
<p class="p">As of version 1.54, there is an <samp class="ph codeph">asyncPolling</samp> parameter that
overcomes this problem. It causes a postponement of the check() in the next polling
and gives a chance for the execution flows caused by the interaction to complete.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to make this behavior as default as there are many
tests that are coded against the old behavior.</p>
<p class="p">The suggested approach is to set <samp class="ph codeph">asyncPolling</samp> as default for all
<samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statements:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">// in QUnit start page, before all OPA tests
Opa5.extendConfig({
    autoWait: true,
    asyncPolling: true
});</pre>
<p class="p">Setting <samp class="ph codeph">asyncPolling</samp> on existing tests may cause a failure because
of the more strict synchronization. The most common uncovered problem is a test that
is dependent on premature synchronization, such as an assertion for table rows that
is executed before the table is fully loaded.</p>
<p class="p">Same parameter can be set for individual <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statements:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">// in an OPA test
oOpa.waitFor({
    id: &quot;controlId&quot;,
    asyncPolling: true,
    success: function (oControl) {
        // TODO assert status
    }
});</pre>
