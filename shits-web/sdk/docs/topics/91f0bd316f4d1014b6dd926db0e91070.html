This
page does not provide general information about cross-site scripting but focuses on what you
as an application developer using <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> can do to avoid these security issues.</p><p class="p">To give a short info on XSS: It is about injecting script code into a
web page, which is then executed in the context of the page and therefore not
only can access any information which currently displayed on the screen but can
either access session information contained in cookies, or send new requests to
the server within the current session, or even try to exploit browser
vulnerabilities to get full access to the machine the browser is running on.
</p><div class="section" id="loio91f0bd316f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_04390290F9604EFFB4DB3019FA3E9F73"><section class="section" type="Cross-site Scripting in OpenUI5-based Web Applications"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Cross-site Scripting in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>-based Web Applications</h2>

<p class="p">AJAX frameworks in general are an interesting target for XSS exploits,
as not only the HTML which is initially sent to the browser may contain
vulnerabilities, but also the code which is used to visualize content on the
client side may have bugs which can be exploited to get the JavaScript coding
executed on the client side. In addition to that, once a script has injected an
AJAX application, it will be alive for a long time, as usually navigation will
not reload the whole page which would also clean up any running JavaScript
code, but stays within the same HTML document and uses a delta update mechanism
to show new content.
</p>
<p class="p">It is important to understand that <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is not involved in creating the HTML page which is
sent to the client, so there is no way <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> can prevent XSS vulnerabilities which
are contained in the HTML page itself. The application which is using the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
rendering has to take care, according to the documentation of their server-side
rendering framework, to properly escape user data, in a way that no JavaScript can
be injected. </p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> framework will take care of proper escaping for all content which is created and
displayed on the screen using the controls provided by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. There is no need for
the application to HTML-escape user data, but the control API expects all data to be
unescaped, so that it can be escaped as needed for the context it will be
visualized. </p>

<div class="section" id="loio91f0bd316f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_fdr_tzl_xcb"><section class="section" type="HTML Sanitizer"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">HTML Sanitizer</h2>

<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> reuses the HTML4
sanitizer by Google by adapting it for the use of HTML5 coding. The Google sanitizer
also supports CSS3 coding. In addition, the HTML5 sanitizer uses the URL whitelist
which checks embedded URLs for correct formatting or against a given whitelist.</p>
<p class="p">For adapting the sanitizer to support HTML5, the HTML attributes and elements have
been reorganized according to the current HTML5 specification from W3C. All types
and flags have been reviewed as accurately as possible and HTML4 elements that are
no longer used in HTML5 have been removed. You can, however, still see them as
comments. New or changed rules for HTML5 have been marked are &quot;new&quot; within the
comments. The comments also state which attributes and elements are assigned to
respective types and flags. All rules which were not 100% clear were analyzed in a
way of similarity, so for example &quot;audio&quot; and &quot;video&quot; content behaves like images
etc. URIEFFECTS state if a URL is loaded inplace within a tag where the actual
document is in control of what type of content is loaded like &quot;image&quot; or if a new
document is loaded like with &quot;a href&quot;. LOADERTYPES state if content is loaded as
sandboxed which means it is loaded within a specific surrounding player like with
video content for example or if it is loaded freely without restrictions. Internally
controls which accept arbitrary HTML content like the
<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.richttexteditor.RichTextEditor</samp> or the
<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.HTML</samp> use the HTML5 Sanitizer to sanitize the HTML
code of their content and value to not infiltrate any dangerous coding. The option
to sanitize the value can be enabled or disabled in the respective control properly
via property: <samp class="ph codeph">RichTextEditor.sanitizeValue</samp> or
<samp class="ph codeph">HTML.sanitizeContent</samp>. For the HTML control, it is disabled by
default whereas for the RichTextEditor the sanitize option is enabled. </p>
