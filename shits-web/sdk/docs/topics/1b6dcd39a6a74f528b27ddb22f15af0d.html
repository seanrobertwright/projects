<p class="p">In classical Web applications, the server determines which resource is requested based on the URL pattern of the request and serves it accordingly. The
server-side logic controls how the requested resource or page is displayed in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="p">In single-page applications, only one page is initially requested from the server and
additional resources are dynamically loaded using client-side logic. The user only
navigates within this page. The navigation is persisted in the hash instead of the
server path or URL parameters.</p>
<p class="p"> For example, a classical Web application might display the employee&#x2019;s resume page when URL
<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/employees/resume.html?id=3</samp>
or
<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/employees/3/resume</samp>
is called. A single-page application instead would do the same thing by using a
hash-based URL like
<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/#/employees/3/resume</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">The information in the hash, namely everything that is following the <samp class="ph codeph">#</samp> character, is interpreted by the router. </p>

<p class="p">This tutorial does not handle cross-app navigation with the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span>. However, the concepts described in this tutorial are also fundamental for
navigation and routing between apps in the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span>.</p></aside>
<div class="p">We will create a simple app displaying the data of a company&#x2019;s employees to show typical
navigation patterns and routing features. The complete flow of the application can be
seen in the figure below. We&apos;ll start with the home page which lets users do the
following:<ul class="ul" id="loio1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d__ul_z4g_yx4_ls">
<li class="li">

<p class="p">Throughout this tutorial we will add features for navigating to pages and bookmarking them. We
will add backward and forward navigation with common transition animations (slide, show,
flip, etc.). We will add more pages to the app and navigate between them to show typical
use cases. We will even learn how to implement features for bookmarking a specific
search, table sorting via filters, and dialogs.</p>
