<p class="p">All integration tests are located in the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/integration</span> folder
and can be started manually by calling the <span class="ph filepath">opaTests.qunit.html</span>
file in the same folder or the entry page. Similar to the unit tests, the HTML page
is a QUnit runner that calls all integration tests of the app and displays the test
results in a readable format. It also might be omitted by other testrunners. There
are also two namespaces defined for the app and the integration test folder as you
have seen in the unit test setup.</p>
<p class="p">We write integration tests with OPA5 &#x2013; a tool that is integrated and delivered with SAPUI5. It is the short name for One-Page Acceptance tests
for SAPUI5. &quot;One-Page&quot; here means that OPA5 is designed for single-page Web applications, i.e. applications that consist only of one
HTML file. OPA5 runs in the same browser window as the application to be tested.</p>
<aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_0_title"><div class="title" id="note_0_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<p class="p">There is also a stand-alone version of OPA5 called <span class="q">&#x201C;OPA&#x201D;</span> available that can be used for
testing any kind of single-page Web application and that does not provide any
<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>-specific
functionality. In this tutorial, <span class="q">&#x201C;OPA&#x201D;</span> always refers to OPA5. It includes
functionality for easily finding and matching <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
controls as well as their
properties and aggregations.</p></aside>

<p class="p">For structuring integration tests with OPA we use <span class="q">&#x201C;journeys&#x201D;</span>. A test journey
contains all test cases for a specific view or use case, for example the navigation
journey simulates user interaction with the app.</p>
<p class="p">The journey uses another structuring element of OPA called <span class="q">&#x201C;page object&#x201D;</span> that encapsulates actions and assertions needed to describe the
journey. Typically those are related to a view in the app but there can also be stand-alone pages for browsers or common
functionality.</p>
<aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_1_title"><div class="title" id="note_1_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<p class="p">When you first start writing tests, you may find it difficult to figure out the correct
control locators. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Test Recorder</span> tool can suggest a
solution in the form of a code snippet. For most controls, it can find a
combination of matchers that match a single control. Then, all you need to do is
copy the code snippet to your OPA5 page object. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="../../#/topic/2535ef9272064cb6bd6b44e5402d531d.html" title="The Test Recorder tool supports app developers who write integration and system tests." target="_top">Test Recorder</a>.</p></aside>

<p class="p">Let&#x2019;s add our first new OPA test to the <span class="ph filepath">WorklistJourney.js</span> file. We
describe all test cases related to the worklist logic. We can see that there is
already a test <samp class="ph codeph">Should see the table with all posts</samp> defined that
checks if the table contains the expected number of items. There is a function
<samp class="ph codeph">opaTest</samp> that initiates a test description and receives a test
description as the first argument as well as a callback function as the second
argument. This format is similar to the unit test function
<samp class="ph codeph">QUnit.test</samp> except for the three arguments of the callback
function that are specific to OPA.</p>
<p class="p">The three objects <samp class="ph codeph">Given</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">When</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">Then</samp> are
filled by the OPA runtime when the test is executed and contain the
<samp class="ph codeph">arrangements</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">actions</samp>, and
<samp class="ph codeph">assertions</samp> for the test. The &quot;Given-When-Then&quot; pattern is a
common style for writing tests in a readable format. To describe a test case, you
basically write a user story. Test cases in this format are easy to understand, even
by non-technical people.</p>
<div class="p">Let&#x2019;s give it a try with our new feature that only displays 20 posts in the table
initially and will load more posts when we press a trigger button or scroll down.
Here is our user story &quot;Should see the table with all posts&quot; and its code
representation:<ul class="ul" id="loio1b47457cbe4941ee926317d827517acb__ul_rzp_jsr_jt">
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Arrangements</span></p>
<p class="p">Define possible initial states, e.g. the app is started, or specific data
exists. For performance reasons, starting the app is usually done only
in the first test case of a journey.
<samp class="ph codeph">Given.iStartMyApp();</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Actions</span></p>
<p class="p">Define possible events triggered by a user, e.g. entering some text,
clicking a button, navigating to another page.
<samp class="ph codeph">When.onTheWorklistPage.iPressOnMoreData();</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Assertions</span></p>
<p class="p">Define possible verifications, e.g. do we have the correct amount of items displayed, does a label display the right data, is a list filled.
At the end of the test case, the app is destroyed again. This is typically done only once in the last test case of the
journey for performance reasons. <samp class="ph codeph">Then.onTheWorklistPage.theTableShouldHaveAllEntries
().and.iTeardownMyApp();</samp></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Please also note that you have to move the <samp class="ph codeph">and.iTeardownMyApp()</samp> concatenation from the previous <samp class="ph codeph">opaTest</samp>
function and put it at the end of the last test of a journey, in this case this is our new test. For performance reasons, we only
start and destroy the app once per journey, as it takes several seconds to load the app. You can concatenate actions and assertions
with the OPA helper object and in an easily readable way. The functions will be executed one after another.</p>
<p class="p">Now you might wonder where all those descriptive functions and the helper object
<samp class="ph codeph">onTheWorklistPage</samp> are coming from. The answer is simple, the
<samp class="ph codeph">onTheWorklistPage</samp> object is a structuring element of OPA and
inside we will implement the actions and assertions used in this test.</p>

<p class="p">As you can see, the OPA page object is constructed with the call <samp class="ph codeph">Opa5.createPageObjects</samp> and a <samp class="ph codeph">configuration</samp>
object that contains the actions and assertions properties.</p>
<p class="p">For our test case we need to add an action <samp class="ph codeph">iPressOnMoreData</samp> and an
existing assertion <samp class="ph codeph">theTableShouldHaveAllEntries</samp>. OPA tests are
running asynchronously, so each action and assertion starts with a
<samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statement. The OPA run time will check and wait for the
condition to be fulfilled every 400 ms by polling. If the condition is met, the
<samp class="ph codeph">success</samp> function of the configuration is called. If the
condition is still not fulfilled after a certain amount of time (by default it is 15
seconds but this can be configured) the test will fail.</p>
<div class="p">Let&#x2019;s start with the action <samp class="ph codeph">iPressOnMoreData</samp>. We define a
<samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statement with the current view and the table. Those
IDs are stored as internal variables in the <samp class="ph codeph">require</samp> statement above
and are available in all tests. OPA will now try to find the table based on IDs. As
soon as the table is available on the screen and it can be interacted with (it is
visible, not busy,...), the <samp class="ph codeph">Press</samp> action is invoked, if not, the
error message is displayed and the test fails. When executed on a table, the
<samp class="ph codeph">Press</samp> action will simulate that a users chooses the
<span class="ph uicontrol">More Data</span> button. <aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_2_title"><div class="title" id="note_2_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">Press</samp> action depends on the control that it is triggered
on and has a default behavior for most UI controls. If you, for example,
execute <samp class="ph codeph">Press</samp> on a <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Page</samp>, this will
trigger the <span class="ph uicontrol">Back</span> button&apos;s <samp class="ph codeph">Press</samp>
event. This behavior can be overridden by passing an ID as argument to the
action. <span class="ph">For more information, see the <a class="xref" href="../../#/api/sap.ui.test.actions.Press" target="_top" alt="#/api/sap.ui.test.actions.Press" title="#/api/sap.ui.test.actions.Press">API Reference: <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.test.actions.Press</samp></a>.</span>
</p></aside></div>
<p class="p">The assertion <samp class="ph codeph">theTableShouldHaveAllEntries</samp> is structured similarly, but it does not trigger an action. Here, we use the
<samp class="ph codeph">success</samp> function of <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> to assert if our application is in the expected state. This state is defined
by the matchers (in our case we expect that the list contains 23 items by using the <samp class="ph codeph">AggregationLengthEquals</samp>. The
<samp class="ph codeph">success</samp> function does not execute the additional checks that are needed for triggering an action. the liste does not have
to be <samp class="ph codeph">interactable</samp> to verify that the state of the application is correct..</p>
<div class="p">With this helper object we can simply check the length of the table aggregation <samp class="ph codeph">items</samp> to the expected number of items. We have
23 entries in our local mock data that we also use for this integration test. You can see that the number of items is actually
hard-coded in the test. So only if the table has exactly 23 items, the matcher is evaluating to <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp> and the
assertion is passed successfully. <aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_3_title"><div class="title" id="note_3_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<p class="p">The items in our app are served from the mock server with a slight delay so that we can see how a real service on a backend
system would behave. Even if we would have a real backend, we would purposely use the mock server for manual testing and for
using them in our test cases as the test data remains stable and unchanged. This creates a more reliable test environment and
easier tests. So we can write a test that checks exactly for 23 items here.</p></aside>Now run the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html</span> file and make sure that the test is failing. When
our new test is invoked, OPA will run into a timeout because the trigger area is not found yet. You can see more information, if you
open the developer console of your browser and check the messages in the console.</div>
