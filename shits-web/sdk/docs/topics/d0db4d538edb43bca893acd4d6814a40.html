overkill for most minor style adaptations. For those minor changes, the
recommendation is to include additional CSS into the page which changes the style of
the respective tags of the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> control. This
allows complete, arbitrary changes of the visual design - after all it is the same
technology that the UI5 controls use for their styling.</p><p class="p"> The main options are
the following:</p><ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_dkq_lsy_c4">
<li class="li">Inspect the HTML and CSS of a control and write a similar, but adapted CSS rule
for a CSS property you want to override for all controls of a type.</li>
<li class="li">Call <samp class="ph codeph">.addStyleClass(&quot;myStyle&quot;)</samp> on some control instances if you
want only those instances to look different from other instances - and then
write CSS code that refers to the normal classes/tags and to the CSS class you
just added.</li>
</ul><aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_0_title"><div class="title" id="note_0_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_rdg_g3s_f4">

<li class="li">With this high degree of power and flexibility comes quite some
responsibility. With CSS you can easily break the functionality of a
control. This is not <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>-specific, but when you make CSS adaptions, you should always have good
knowledge of this open standard.</li>
<li class="li">The inner structure of a control, the tag hierarchy, the IDs and CSS classes
are <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> part of the public control API for which we
guarantee stability. This is also the case for other UI libraries which
might define some CSS classes as stable, but not everything else. As CSS can
refer to the inner structures of a control, you have
to
accept the risk that your style changes break when
we
change the inner structure. Changing the inner structure
is
a freedom we absolutely need to reserve, so we can fix
bugs and add features of a
control.</li>
<li class="li">When your CSS does not work as expected, use the developer tools in your
browser to inspect the page and check which CSS rules are applied to the
respective tag, and which rules might be applied but are overridden by other
rules. If your rules are overridden by other rules, this is probably due to
their order of appearance (last rule wins) or the CSS selector specificity
(more specific CSS selectors win). </li>

standard way, which means loaded by a<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp> element in the
<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;head&gt;</samp> of a page, and all libraries declared in the
respective attribute of the <samp class="ph codeph">script</samp> tag), it is sufficient to just
add the custom CSS to any place after the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp> element. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> will insert its
CSS links immediately after the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp> tag, so any
subsequent CSS will appear further down in the DOM and can thus overwrite the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
CSS.</p><p class="p">However, it is important to understand the precedence rules of CSS: The
order of
appearance
is not the only factor that determines which one of two or more conflicting rules
wins. Actually it is only the least important factor. The most important (and maybe
least known) factor is the specificity of the selector belonging to a rule.</p><p class="p">
For example, if one rule says <samp class="ph codeph">button {color:red;}</samp> to make all
button texts red, and a second rule says <samp class="ph codeph">div &gt; button
{color:green;}</samp> to make all button texts, which are direct children of a
<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> element, green, the second rule always wins because
it is more specific. The order of appearance in the DOM does not matter in this
case. It would only matter if both rules started with an equal selector, such as
<samp class="ph codeph">button{color:***}</samp>.</p><p class="p"> The order of loading is completely
irrelevant, only the position in the DOM counts in this case. If you load <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> without a
<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp> tag in the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;head&gt;</samp>, or if
you do not specify all used control libraries in the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp>
tag, but loaded some of them later on when the body was already loaded, you can
still make sure a custom CSS appears further down in the DOM by loading it with
<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.includeStyleSheet(stylesheetUrl[,
id])</samp><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">after</span> loading <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> or the
dynamically loaded control library.</p><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Related

<div class="section collapsible"><section class="section collapsible" type="Why do OpenUI5 controls not have a style property where I can make arbitrary changes?"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Why do <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> controls not have a <samp class="ph codeph">style</samp> property where I can make arbitrary changes?</h2>

<p class="p">A control usually does not map to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">one</span> HTML element, but to a
whole tree of HTML elements. Whatever is set for the <samp class="ph codeph">style</samp> property
would probably be added to the root element of this HTML tree, and only there, so
there is no <samp class="ph codeph">style</samp> access to inner parts. If you just want to
override the height of a button, this would actually work. But as soon as a change
is a bit more complex, it will not work that easily. A more complex change is, for
example, adapting the height of a <samp class="ph codeph">ComboBox</samp> control. The outer
<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> will get the proper height. And incidentally also
the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;input&gt;</samp> tag inside, as it has 100% height set. But the
dropdown arrow and the respective button-kind-of-thing has a fixed height, and the
whole control will look pretty broken then.</p>
<p class="p">In other cases, when HTML elements that break the CSS inheritance chain are nested,
for example, <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;table&gt;</samp> and font settings, you can change
<samp class="ph codeph">style</samp> to a different font and text color, but it will simply do
nothing.</p>
<p class="p">In general, we try to expose the obvious adaptation content in the API, for example,
the button height. But the less obvious adaptations might have to be supported from
inside the control to work properly, and
as
we cannot foresee and support everything you can do with a <samp class="ph codeph">style</samp>
property, we raise the bar a little bit by requiring you to write
CSS (potentially using <samp class="ph codeph">.addStyleClass(&#x2026;)</samp> for the respective
control). With CSS you can do what you cannot do with a <samp class="ph codeph">style</samp>
property: tweak the inner HTML components of a control.</p>
<p class="p">Applications (at least the more traditional ones &#x2013; currently this seems to be less of
a rule, but I&#x2019;m not sure it will stay like this forever) need to conform to some
visual design guideline and, in general, it is not even desired that applications
change the <samp class="ph codeph">TextField</samp> height or use font just the way they like. As
you can use CSS, UI5 still supports that, but we shouldn&#x2019;t make breaking the visual
design a rule in our official API.</p>

<p class="p">If you want to change some styling and use <samp class="ph codeph">control.addStyleClass(&#x2026;)</samp>
to add a CSS class, but it does not seem to work, you first have to pin down exactly
what is not working:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ol_xnq_lsy_c4">
<li class="li">Has the style class not been added to the HTML?</li>
<li class="li">Has the style class been added correctly, but the style you supplied not been
applied by the browser?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You can check this by inspecting the HTML with your browser&apos;s developer tools.</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_u4q_lsy_c4">
<li class="li">If the style class has really not been added to a control, bear in mind that some entities
are not controls, but only elements (inherited from
<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Element</samp>). Only some of them support
<samp class="ph codeph">addStyleClass</samp>.</li>
<li class="li">If the style class is available in the HTML, the bug is inside the CSS styles
you supplied: <ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_arq_lsy_c4">
<li class="li">Are they loaded by the browser?</li>
<li class="li">Are the selectors matching the element you want to style? You can again
check in the developer tools: They mostly list all styles which apply,
but some are overriding others (those are usually listed with a
strikethrough). If your style is not listed at all, your CSS selector is
probably not correct.</li>
<li class="li">If your selector is fine, but other style rules override your styles (potentially those
from the original UI5 theme), then the CSS precedence rules determined
this.

on specificity.</li>
<li class="li">Maybe your browser does not understand the CSS styles you have written.
Some browsers still display them in the developer tools, some don&apos;t, so
you might want to try changing very common styles like the border to
check whether selector and specificity are fine.</li>
