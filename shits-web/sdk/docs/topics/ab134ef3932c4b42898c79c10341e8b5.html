<div class="section"><section class="section" type="The Initial App"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">The Initial App</h2>

<p class="p">With the downloaded code, you now have the bulletin board prototype, set up according to the
<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> best
practices. The prototype provides the common features of an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> app. If you have
completed the Walkthrough tutorial, you should be familiar with most of the source
code in this step. Additional features of the app are:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_sv2_3kq_ls">
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Entry Page</span></p>
<p class="p">In this tutorial, we will often switch between testing application features manually, and
running automated tests. The <span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/test.html</span> file
provides a list of entry points for the app so that you do not have to enter
the URLs manually. From this page you can open the app with mock data, run
the unit tests, run the integration tests, or run the app&#x2019;s test suite (this
will be added later in the tutorial). Note that in a productive scenario we
would have an additional entry point that calls the app with a real service.
At this stage we are working with mock data and don&apos;t have a real service
for our prototype yet, so we have left this step out.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Home Page</span></p>
<div class="p">The home page of our bulletin board app is the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/mockServer.html</span> file. On this page, we
initialize <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, start the mock server, and instantiate our app component. It consists of
a single view that displays a list of posts from a bulletin board with
several attributes in a table.<aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_1_title"><div class="title" id="note_1_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<p>We do not yet have a real service for
the bulletin board prototype so run the app with mock data and this test
page throughout the tutorial. The mock server helps by mimicking a real
service and it processes requests with a small delay, just as a real
service would. This is perfect for realistic application testing and is
also helpful for local development tests. It is a good practice to put
all test pages in the test folder of the app, so that they are clearly
separated from the productive coding.</p></aside></div>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Data</span></p>
<div class="p">In the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/localService/</span> folder, you can find the metadata and the
mock data for the app. The <span class="ph filepath">metadata.xml</span> file is used by
the mock server to simulate real back-end service calls in the app. It
describes our OData service and you can replace it later with a real
service. The service we use has
a
single OData entity:<ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_fxr_y1y_2t">
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Post</span></p>
<p class="p">A post consists of typical properties like
<span class="ph uicontrol">Title</span>,
<span class="ph uicontrol">Description</span>, and
<span class="ph uicontrol">Price</span>. Each post is assigned to a
<span class="ph uicontrol">Category</span> and a
<span class="ph uicontrol">Contact</span>. The entity can be identified
with its ID property: <samp class="ph codeph">PostID</samp>. The corresponding
<samp class="ph codeph">EntitySet</samp> is <samp class="ph codeph">Posts</samp>. </p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Category</span></p>
<p class="p">In our example, the category only has a <samp class="ph codeph">Name</samp>
property. Posts are sorted into a category by the category name.
The corresponding <samp class="ph codeph">EntitySet</samp> is
<samp class="ph codeph">Categories</samp>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Comment</span></p>
<p class="p">A comment has an <samp class="ph codeph">Author</samp>, a
<samp class="ph codeph">Date</samp>, and a <samp class="ph codeph">CommentText</samp>
property. The entity can be identified by the
<samp class="ph codeph">CommentID</samp> property and is linked to a
<samp class="ph codeph">post</samp> by the <samp class="ph codeph">ParentID</samp>. The
corresponding <samp class="ph codeph">EntitySet</samp> is
<samp class="ph codeph">Comments</samp>.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="p">The actual test data containing several mock posts is located in the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/service/posts.json</span> file.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Testing Functionality</span></p>
<div class="p">The team that created the first prototype already took care of the basic test setup.
Everything required for application testing is shipped with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> and can
simply be used within the app. The testing infrastructure is set up in the
<span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder that is located in the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder of the app:<ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_kmn_gby_2t">
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Mock Server</span></p>
<p class="p">The mock server is set up in the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/localService/mockserver.js</span>
file. It loads the metadata and the mock data in the same
folder. Using the mock server allows us to run the app easily
and show realistic data for testing, even without a network
connection and without the need of having a remote server for
our application data.</p>
<p class="p">There is a configurable delay for each request that is processed by the mock server that
allows you to mimick a slow back-end server.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Unit Tests</span></p>
<p class="p">All unit tests are located in the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/unit</span> folder and can be
started by calling the <span class="ph filepath">unitTests.qunit.html</span>
file in the same folder. Initially, there are only a few tests
for model instantiation and formatters that cover basic
functionality in the prototype. We will give you more details
about the unit test setup later in the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Integration Tests</span></p>
<p class="p">Integration tests are written in OPA5 &#x2013; a tool for integration testing that is included
in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> &#x2013; and can be found in the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/integration</span> folder. You can
start all OPA5 tests by calling the
<span class="ph filepath">opaTests.qunit.html</span> file in the same
folder. OPA5 tests are organized in test journeys, and we have
included a worklist journey that checks if the table of posts is
displayed properly. We will give you more details about the
integration test setup later in the tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Other quality-related features of the app</span></p>
<div class="p">The app is set up according to best practices and already contains many helpful features.
<ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_lcw_wby_2t">
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Separation of concerns (MVC)</span></p>
<p class="p">All artifacts are located in either the <span class="ph filepath">model</span>, <span class="ph filepath">view</span>, or <span class="ph filepath">controller</span> folder of
the app. The app&#x2019;s component and its descriptor configure which of those MVC artifacts to load. This configuration
controls the navigation flow of the app.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Separation of productive and nonproductive
code</span></p>
<p class="p">All nonproductive code is located in the
<span class="ph filepath">test</span> subfolder. This includes the unit
and integration tests, and the test page to call the app with
mock data. All productive code is located in the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder. This clearly separates
the test artifacts from the application coding and makes it easy
to remove all test-related artifacts before deploying the app
for productive use.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Busy handling</span></p>
<p class="p">As a best practice, you should always give users instant feedback
when triggering actions and navigating in the app. The app
already includes functionality to display a busy indication when
data is loaded or actions are triggered. To simulate a slow
backend and show the behavior of the app, the mock server is
configured with a delay of one second for each request.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Now that we have a running prototype, we can further extend it with additional tests and
features. Make sure that the app is running by calling the test page, the unit
tests, and the integration tests from the entry page
<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/test.html</span>. The app should display a list of
bulletin board posts as seen in the screenshot above and the tests should run
without errors.</p>
</section></div>
<div class="section"><section class="section" type="Test Strategy"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Test Strategy</h2>

<p class="p">Let&#x2019;s first take a look at best practices for testing apps written in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. JavaScript is a
dynamic programming language and only some issues can be detected by static code
check tools and manual testing. Automated tests that execute the code regularly are
beneficial for good quality and development productivity &#x2013; especially when you&apos;re
developing in short development cycles.</p>
<p class="p">We expect our prototype to be released and shipped as a product soon, so we need a solid
testing strategy. Fortunately the prototype team has already thought ahead and
prepared an infrastructure for unit and integration testing that is included in the
app. This is a really good starting point for further enhancements of the app.</p>
<p class="p">The mock server is also set up and allows us to test the app with local test data
instead of a real back-end service. We can use the mock data for writing reliable
integration tests that do not depend on another system which might be unavailable
when the tests are run.</p>
<aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_2_title"><div class="title" id="note_2_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<p>If you start developing an app from scratch, you should always consider testing from the
very beginning of the software life cycle. Nobody wants to write tests for
undocumented code and make assumptions about the logic. It is worth the effort to
think about code checks, unit and integration testing, and a solid testing strategy
from the very start.</p></aside>
<p class="p">Before you start implementing your first test, you should think about how to test the
different aspects of your application. The image below shows the testing tools along
the agile testing pyramid.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__fig_u2g_t2y_2t"><div class="figbody">

<img class="inline" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__image_tpl_52y_2t" src="loio88758c3b4ad94e9ca6508d106fe66972_LowRes.png">
</div><span class="figcap">Testing pyramid</span></div>
<p class="p">When you set up application testing, you should automate as many testing steps as possible. If
you immediately write a test for all the features that we implement, then you can
greatly reduce manual testing efforts that are time consuming and cumbersome. If you
change something later, you can simply run the existing tests and see if the
functionality is still working as expected.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> comes with two testing
tools: QUnit for unit testing and OPA5 for integration testing. The unit tests are
the foundation of our testing pyramid and they should validate the most important
logic of our app. In addition, you can write integration tests for more
interaction-related functionality, such as interacting with UI elements of the app. </p>
<p class="p">There might still be features that are hard to test with these client-side testing frameworks.
Certain features might require a more sophisticated system test, such as a
screenshot comparison that can be implemented with additional testing frameworks.
And of course, you should also schedule manual tests (for example, browser,
performance, or security tests) to make sure that the app is behaving as expected. </p>
