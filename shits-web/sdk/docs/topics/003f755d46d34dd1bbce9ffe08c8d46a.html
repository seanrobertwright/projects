<p class="p">The 3 main folders in an application are the <span class="ph filepath">root</span> folder, the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder and the
<span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder. Regarding their structure, the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder should be inside the
<span class="ph filepath">root</span> folder, and the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder should be located inside the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder, as shown below:</p>

example. This applies to all images contained within this topic.</p></aside>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">root</span> Folder</span></p>
<p class="p">The root folder should contain files that are not part of your application coding.
Examples are build configuration files, such as a <span class="ph filepath">pom.xml</span> for
maven or a <span class="ph filepath">Gruntfile.js</span> for node/grunt, and documentation files
like <span class="ph filepath">readme.md</span> or <span class="ph filepath">txt</span>. These files may
also be grouped in folders if needed. For example, you could group all documentation
files into a <span class="ph filepath">doc</span> folder.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> Folder</span></p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder contains all the code that is related to the
application. This means running and extending the application using the
<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">extensibility</span> mechanism offered by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. This includes
the JavaScript files for the logic, view files written in xml, html, json or js
format, and also files for <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">localization</span>, such as
<span class="ph filepath">i18n.properties</span> files. Any files that are only relevant for
testing should be put inside the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder. For more details
about the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder, see the section below. For more
information about extensibility and localization, see <a class="xref" href="../../#/topic/a264a9abf98d4caabbf9b027bc1005d8.html" title="You can adapt an OpenUI5 app to your specific requirements. For example, you can adapt or replace views, extend or replace controllers, or change language-specific texts." target="_top">Extending Apps</a> and <a class="xref" href="../../#/topic/91f217c46f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="The framework concepts for text localization in OpenUI5 are aligned with the general concepts of the Java platform." target="_top">Localization</a> respectively.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">test</span> Folder</span></p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder contains all of the files needed for running automated
tests for your application, as well as for launching your application in a sandbox
mode so that you can do manual testing. For more details about the
<span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder, see the section below.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Why Use 3 Separate Folders?</span></p>
<p class="p">To achieve sound performance when loading your application, the code you deploy to your
production servers should only contain a <span class="ph filepath">component-preload.js</span>
and a <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file. This means that when you create a
package with a build, it is easier if all the files you really want to deploy are
inside <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">one</span> folder. This is true no matter which build framework
you use. We recommend using the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder for this. Nothing
inside the <span class="ph filepath">root</span> folder is needed for running the app, so it&apos;s
not included on a production server serving your application. The content of the
<span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder has to be executed in design time and during
the automated test execution on a central server. We choose to include it inside the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder, to be able to reference resources of the
<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder relatively to the <span class="ph filepath">test</span>
folder. This folder has to be excluded when you are building a
<span class="ph filepath">component-preload.js</span>. You should never reference resources
of the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder from your application, because when you
deploy to a productive environment, the resource cannot be loaded. For more
information about the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file, see <a class="xref" href="../../#/topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library." target="_top">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>.</p>

3 folders related to the MVC (model, view, controller) pattern used in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, as well as a
localization folder and a local-services folder used for emulating OData services.
Each of these folders is outlined below.</p>
<p class="p">For standalone app, this folder also contains an <span class="ph filepath">index.html</span> file that is used to start the app and to instantiate the
component. If your apps is built for the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span> no <span class="ph filepath">index.html</span> file is created but only files for

<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">views</span> and <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">fragments</span>. This folder should
not contain any application logic, so no JavaScript files unless you are using
JavaScript views. JavaScript views are not recommended because it is easier to mix
controller logic when building up a view. In declarative views this is not possible.
In the example shown below, the <span class="ph filepath">view</span> folder contains a mixture
of views and fragments. If this folder gets too big, you might consider adding
subfolders to group views by their semantics. In this example for instance, you
could add a <span class="ph filepath">detail</span> folder and move all views that are related
to the detail area of your application to this subfolder.</p><div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_crm_5bb_zs"><div class="figbody">

<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">integration</span> folder contains the OPA tests of your application. We
decided to separate our unit and integration tests, since the execution time of the
integration tests is much longer. While the unit tests run in less than 10 seconds,
the integration tests run for over 2 minutes. These times will vary a lot depending
on the size of your project. If the project grows and grows, the difference in the
execution time will also grow. For this reason, we recommend making both kind of
tests separately executable so that developers can choose which sets of tests they
want to run during design time.</p>
