offers advanced theming concepts and functions which can be used optionally. These concepts
are outlined in detail below.</p>
<div class="section"><section class="section" type="CSS Variables, Functions and More"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">CSS Variables, Functions and More</h2>

<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> uses the popular
CSS preprocessor <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank" alt="http://lesscss.org/" title="http://lesscss.org/">
LESS<img src="themes/sap-default/img/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"></a>. This tool introduces several features, including CSS variables, a
concept which has also been heavily demanded by the CSS community: In any
UI5-controlled CSS file, variables can be defined and can then be referenced
anywhere in the CSS code of the same library. These variables are mainly used for
colors. All CSS variables are global. The CSS variable concept contributes to a
consistent way of implementing and changing the styles.</p>
<p class="p">LESS adds more features like color calculations, mixins, and CSS selector nesting.
The color calculations are used in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> to derive many
different color shades from just a few variables.</p>
<p class="p">Here is the syntax:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">@sapUiText: #000000; /* define the text color as &apos;black&apos; */

button {
   color: @sapUiText; /* buttons will automatically have the current text color, which is &apos;#000000&apos; right now */
    [...]
}
</pre>
<p class="p">LESS then takes care of substituting all references to a CSS variable by the current
value of this variable. This happens during the build of the control library.</p>
<aside class="note" aria-labelledby="note_0_title"><div class="title" id="note_0_title"><strong>Note</strong></div>
<p>In development scenarios this LESS processing might even happen at runtime in the
browser to shorten the build time for <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> libraries. This
is indicated by a <span class="ph uicontrol">less mode</span> rectangle when a page is
launched.</p></aside>
<p class="p">Additionally, a specific theme can modify the CSS parameter values given by the base
theme. So a control can just define its text color to use <samp class="ph codeph">sapUiText</samp>
by default which will automatically take care of applying the correct color for
every theme or user modification: The theme generation will create one CSS file per
theme, and the substitution of the CSS parameter references will always take the
theme-dependent value into account. So a visually very different theme can easily be
created by simply changing a number of colors.</p>
<p class="p">While every library and control can introduce their own CSS variables, those defined
in <span class="ph filepath">global.css</span> are most important. Ideally, there should only be
a few of them, and they should be simple enough to be understood by most end users
(similar to what the Windows operating system offers end users), but still cover as
many aspects of the visual appearance as necessary to make them sufficient for most
customer-required theme modifications. </p>
<p class="p">Additional benefits of CSS variables are, for example:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio45df6dff504647c686ab9ba72af827f6__ul_tlf_bqp_24">
<li class="li">They can be used to generically build simple styling tools that allow for a
limited degree of freedom (=changing the CSS parameter values). The UI theme
designer is an example of such a tool.</li>
<li class="li">They can also be linked to metadata, for example, to which group of colors they
belong, to which colors they need to have some visual contrast.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><section class="section" type="Compilation of One CSS File"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Compilation of One CSS File</h2>

<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> CSS generation does not
only substitute the CSS variable values but also merges all CSS files of a control
library into <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">one</span> file that is loaded at runtime, thus
increasing the performance.</p>
<p class="p">Here are some of the reasons why you would not want to have all styles defined within
one file during development:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio45df6dff504647c686ab9ba72af827f6__ul_kmf_bqp_24">
<li class="li">Less collisions and merging when different developers edit the styles of their controls</li>
<li class="li">Clear separation between the styles for different controls, which helps to estimate and test
the impact of a CSS modification</li>
<li class="li">Keeping the door open for future optimization regarding runtime performance and data
transfer by tailoring CSS files on server side that only contain the CSS
required on the current application page</li>
</ul>
</section></div>
<div class="section"><section class="section" type="Optimization and Compression of CSS Size"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Optimization and Compression of CSS Size </h2>

<p class="p">For performance reasons, the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> CSS generation can optionally remove all comments and unnecessary whitespace and
can compress verbose declarations into a more compact format.</p>
</section></div>
<div class="section"><section class="section" type="Base Theme for Generic Style"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Base Theme for Generic Style</h2>

<p class="p">While some of the style and layout applied using CSS clearly depends on the current theme, and
customers are likely to modify such style rules, there are other style rules that
are required for a control to work properly and unlikely to differ for different
themes. Examples are the overflow behavior, the positioning of popup elements, the
mouse cursor type, the display mode, and others.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> promotes and supports keeping those style definitions in the so-called base theme,
which serves as a common base for all themes.</p>
<p class="p">Themes are built upon this base style that defines their specific visual design by applying
colors and images, sizes and fonts. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> theme generation
takes care of combining the base theme with the specific theme for each generated
theme CSS file. Because the specific CSS is appended to the base theme, a specific
theme can always override styles defined in the base theme. If this step is required
often, the respective style declaration should probably not be located in the base
theme.</p>
<p class="p">Any style declarations which are referencing CSS variables (at least those common ones defined
in the base theme) can also be done in the base theme, and it is sufficient to do it
only there: The CSS generation will apply the correct value for each respective
theme. So this split between base theme and specific themes avoids duplicate
creation and maintenance of CSS parts which are common for all themes and keeps the
CSS files that need to be written for any new theme smaller.</p>
</section></div>
<div class="section"><section class="section" type="Generic Right-to-Left Support"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Generic Right-to-Left Support </h2>

<p class="p">For some countries, right-to-left (RTL) text mode needs to be supported. In order to
avoid the need to create a completely new set of CSS files for those countries, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> supports generic
RTL generation. Basically, this involves switching the right and left margins and
mirroring everything else (including CSS3 rotations, and so on).</p>
<p class="p">Everything else that is not covered by this automatic transformation can be fixed by
using style rules that are only applied in the RTL case.</p>
<p class="p">If you override RTL-specific attributes like text alignment, positioning and so on,
you have to write the RTL equivalent into your application CSS. The attributes below
are critical for RTL support:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio45df6dff504647c686ab9ba72af827f6__ul_jrr_j5t_1r">
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">float</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">clear</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">text-align</samp></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The following attributes require special attention:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio45df6dff504647c686ab9ba72af827f6__ul_pqj_n5t_1r">
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">margin</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">padding</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">border</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">background-position</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">position</samp> (right/left)</li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">text-indent</samp></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Depending on the values, these latter attributes might also need to be mirrored. As
applications running in RTL mode add a <samp class="ph codeph">dir</samp> attribute to the HTML
tag in the DOM, custom styles that have to be written can use the following selector
to handle RTL-specific styling:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">html[dir=&quot;rtl&quot;]  .myselector {
}</pre>
