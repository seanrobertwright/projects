conditions before it passes a control to your matchers/actions/success functions. If
your control doesn&apos;t match these conditions, you&apos;re not able to set a breakpoint.
For such instances, OPA logs lots of information into the browser&apos;s console if you
turn on the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
debug mode. You can either use the <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-debug=true</samp> URL parameter
or the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>

<p class="p">If there are multiple views with the same <samp class="ph codeph">viewName</samp>, OPA5 may not
find the exact control you&apos;re looking for.</p>
<p class="p">As of version 1.62, there are a couple of ways to ensure a correct match:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio698f8c0a889f48d3a8b7fbcd26779be2__ul_tn3_gmr_kgb">
<li class="li">

<samp class="ph codeph">Opa5.extendConfig()</samp>,
<samp class="ph codeph">Opa5.waitFor()</samp> and in page object definitions.
<samp class="ph codeph">viewId</samp> can be used standalone or in combination
with <samp class="ph codeph">viewName</samp>. If OPA5 finds multiple views with the
same name, it prompts you to add a view ID with the test failure message
&quot;Please provide <samp class="ph codeph">viewId</samp> to locate the exact view.&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">Only views that are rendered are used in OPA5 control search.</p>

</ul>
</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
<p class="p subsectiontitle">Control Isn&apos;t Found When Running the Test on a Different Machine or
in a Suite</p>
<p class="p">The size of the iFrame in which the app is loaded is as large as the browser
window. It&apos;s scaled down to leave space for the QUnit info but the content is
preserved the same as when run in full size. This means that regardless of the
small iFrame, you shouldn&apos;t see any responsive change in the app&apos;s
appearance.</p>
<p class="p">If the test runs fine locally but control isn&#x2019;t found on another machine, there&#x2019;s
a chance that the other machine&apos;s screen is too small and triggers the
responsive behaviour of some controls. For example, CI executors with smaller
screens or when the test is part of a suite and the iFrame is placed inside a
suite wrapper much smaller than the screen.</p>
<p class="p">One way is to test for the responsive behavior and add conditional
<samp class="ph codeph">waitFors</samp> and test cases. Tests for different screens, such
as phone and desktop, are better separated in different test files.</p>
<p class="p">If you want to work around the sizing issue and don&apos;t want to test responsive
behavior, you can set a fixed size for the iFrame. The idea is to write the test
for the small size which most probably results in the central environment. You
can use the <samp class="ph codeph">width</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">height</samp> parameters of
<samp class="ph codeph">iStartMyAppInAFrame</samp> or the <samp class="ph codeph">opaFrameWidth</samp>
and <samp class="ph codeph">opaFrameHeight</samp> URL parameters.</p>
<p class="p">If either width or height isn&#x2019;t defined, a default value is assigned. The default
screen size is 1280x1024 px. The iFrame takes 60% of the screen size, which
makes the default iFrame size to be 768x614.4 px.</p>

<p class="p subsectiontitle">Is It the Startup That&apos;s Failing?</p>
<p class="p">Maybe the app is loading too slowly for the OPA tests. If there&apos;s a local index
file that doesn&apos;t contain the library dependencies your app needs, the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> bootstrap is
very slow. To fix this, add the dependencies you need in your application
descriptor&apos;s <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.dependencies</samp> namespace. If you don&apos;t have a
descriptor, use the bootstrap option libs. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="../../#/topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C.

<p class="p subsectiontitle">It&apos;s Failing During the Execution</p>
<p class="p">If this happens, your test is probably executing actions faster than it should.
If you encounter a failure, look at the current state of the UI - in almost all
cases an action couldn&apos;t be triggered or a JavaScript error occurred. This error
should be included in the console logs. If an action couldn&apos;t be executed, make
sure that you use the action parameter of OPA5&apos;s <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp>
function. When using the success function for triggering actions, OPA5 doesn&apos;t
check many things.</p>
<p class="p">Here are some examples that have occurred in known apps:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio698f8c0a889f48d3a8b7fbcd26779be2__ul_lkh_fw1_55">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">An app was using the <samp class="ph codeph">bindingContext</samp> of a control in a
press handler. OPA5 was way faster than a human user, so the
HTTP-Request that was sometimes finished by the time OPA5 was executing
the check, was sometimes still pending and so an exception was thrown.
The test failed because OPA was trying to reach a page that couldn&apos;t be
shown because of this error. This had to be fixed in the app.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">When there was no action parameter available, a <samp class="ph codeph">ListItem</samp>
got rerendered while a press action was executed on it. Due to the
rerendering, the <samp class="ph codeph">List</samp> wasn&apos;t able to perform the click,
meaning it wasn&apos;t executed and the test failed. This only happened on
certain occasions, depending on the execution speed of the machine
executing the test. This is now detected automatically when using
actions.</p>

</ul>

<p class="p subsectiontitle">Am I Comparing Language-Dependent Texts and the Browser Has a

<p class="p">Check the logs to see if your matcher is failing because it&apos;s checking a text

same language, use the <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-language=</samp> URL or bootstrap

<p class="p subsectiontitle">Is It Only Internet Explorer That&apos;s Affected?</p>
<p class="p">If you&apos;re using an IFrame to launch your app, Internet Explorer is more strict
when it comes to objects from removed IFrames. If you&apos;re using the OPA context
to remember objects, destroy your frame, and then execute a function on the
object, you get a JavaScript exception. How do you avoid it? By only remembering
values like strings or integers when destroying the frame, or by using the
component startup in OPA5.</p>

<p class="p">If you require <span class="ph filepath">sinon-qunit.js</span>, it overwrites the browser functions
<samp class="ph codeph">setTimeout</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">setInterval</samp>. OPA needs these
functions and without them the tests don&apos;t start. You can either set the
<samp class="ph codeph">fakeTimers</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">false</samp> in your test setup, or
maybe consider not using <span class="ph filepath">sinon-qunit.js</span> together with OPA.</p>

<p class="p">Examples of such controls are busy indicators, notification popups, and message toasts. These
controls set a timeout after which the control is supposed to disappear. In some
apps, it can be important to ensure that such a control is displayed. Note that if
you enable <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> in your tests globally, then you have to
disable <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> specifically in the <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp>
statements related to these special controls. For example, if you want to test that
a busy indicator is displayed during the sending of a request, you don&apos;t want to
wait for controls to be interactable:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">oOpa.waitFor({
	autoWait: false,
	id: &quot;myBusyList&quot;, // a control that is expected be covered by a busy indicator
	matchers: new PropertyStrictEquals({
