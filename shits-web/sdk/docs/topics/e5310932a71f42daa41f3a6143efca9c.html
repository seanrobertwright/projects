<p class="p">You use data binding to bind UI elements to data sources to keep the data in sync and allow data editing on the UI.</p>
<p class="p">For data binding, you need a model and a binding instance: The model instance holds the data
and provides methods to set the data or to retrieve the data from a server. It also
provides a method for creating bindings to the data. When this method is called, a
binding instance is created, which contains the binding information and provides an
event, which is fired whenever the bound data changes. An element can listen to this
event and update its visualization according to the new data.</p>
<p class="p">The UI uses data binding to bind controls to the model which holds the application data, so that the controls are updated automatically whenever
application data changes. Data binding is also used the other way round, when changes in the control cause updates in the underlying application
data, for example data entered by the user. This is called two-way binding.</p>

This arrangement illustrates a feature known as &quot;two-way data binding&quot;.

Here, data is transported in one direction only: from the model, through the binding instance to the consumer (usually the property of a control), but never in the other direction. In this example, we will change the previous example to use one-way data binding.

The properties within JSON and OData models almost always are arranged in a hierarchical structure. Therefore, we should take a look at how to reference fields in a hierarchically structured model object." target="_top">Step 8: Binding Paths: Accessing Properties in Hierarchically Structured Models</a></strong><br></li><li><strong><a class="link" href="../../#/topic/6fdf0acd0bc24ffdad327cf7e6f9e7e0.html" title="We also want to provide our users a way of contacting Harry Hawk.

These data types can then be applied to controls in order to ensure that the value presented on the screen is formatted correctly, and, if the field is open for input, that the value entered by the user adheres to the requirements of that data type.

The currency data type also has the ability to validate that user input adheres to to the requirements of a currency; however, data type validation functions are managed by OpenUI5, which of itself has no mechanism for reporting error messages back to the UI; therefore, we need a mechanism for reporting error messages raised by validation functions back to the user. In this step, we will connect the entire view to a feature known as the &quot;Message Manager&quot;. Once this connection is established, any validation error messages generated based on the user input will be passed to the message manager which in turn will connect them to the appropriate view and control that caused the error." target="_top">Step 11: Validation Using the Message Manager</a></strong><br></li><li><strong><a class="link" href="../../#/topic/97830de2d7314e93b5c1ee3878a17be9.html" title="Aggregation binding (or &quot;list binding&quot;) allows a control to be bound to a list within the model data and allows relative binding to the list entries by its child controls." target="_top">Step 12: Aggregation Binding Using Templates</a></strong><br></li><li><strong><a class="link" href="../../#/topic/6c7c5c266b534e7ea9a28f861dc515f5.html" title="Now we want to do something with that newly generated list.
