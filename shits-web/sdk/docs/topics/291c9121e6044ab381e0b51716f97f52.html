delivered with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. At
different steps of this tutorial you will write tests using QUnit, OPA5, and the mock

(TDD), and much more. </p>
<p class="p">For the application features that we add, we focus on writing clean and testable code
with the goal of having good test coverage and a high quality app. We will create a
simple full screen app that we will extend with more tests and features throughout the
tutorial.</p>
<p class="p">Imagine the following situation: You and your development team take over a bulletin board
prototype that will be shipped as a product soon. A bulletin board typically consists of
functionality to browse posts and add own offers to the board. However, the prototype
only covers a minimum set of features and tests so far.</p>
<p class="p">With this very minimalistic app as a starting point, we have a good foundation and we can
inspect the most important testing functionality. Furthermore, we want to implement new
features for the app that were requested by the product team using Test Driven
Development and best practices for writing testable code and testing <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> apps.</p>
<p class="p">So why do we do all this? Obviously, writing tests and testable code does not come
without effort. Well, we want to ensure the implementation of a high quality app by
having decent test coverage of our application logic. And we check that our code does
not break by running the automated tests whenever we change something or when we upgrade
to a newer version of the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> framework or other
external libraries. Additionally, we can find bugs proactively and do not need excessive
manual testing anymore so the efforts definitely pay off. Also, when we decide to
refactor something in the future, we can easily verify that the features of the app are
still working as expected.</p>
<p class="p">There are a lot more reasons and many small details that we will address throughout this
tutorial. You can work yourself through the steps by applying the code deltas
individually or by downloading the samples for each step and playing around with it. </p>

JavaScript unit testing with QUnit. Have a look at the official QUnit documentation
to make yourself familiar with basic testing knowledge. Steps 27 to 29 of the
Walkthrough tutorial also cover the test setup in an app that is used throughout
this tutorial.</p>
<p class="p">If you want to automate the test execution using a test runner, you can set this up as
described under <a class="xref" href="../../#/topic/ae448243822448d8ba04b4784f4b09a0.html#loioae448243822448d8ba04b4784f4b09a0" title="To make sure that the code is always tested thoroughly before it is included in a productive app, you should use a test runner that automates tests.

We call it the post page because it displays details of a post. In this step we will introduce a new journey to test the post page. We write tests that trigger typical navigation events with OPA. Testing navigation greatly helps in reducing manual testing efforts as it covers a lot of testing paths. It is good practice to cover every view of your application with at least one test, since OPA will check if an exception is thrown. In this way you can detect critical errors very fast." target="_top">Step 8: Testing Navigation</a></strong><br></li><li><strong><a class="link" href="../../#/topic/4a9f063d4a4143d5b5c10416677f04b6.html" title="Now that we have covered all kinds of tests for navigation, we introduce our Post page that shows details of a post in the bulletin board.
