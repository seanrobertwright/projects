<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> application developer there is no need to change or adapt your applications to
support devices that allow input from both mouse and touch.</p></aside>
<p class="p">When you develop your own controls, then there are some things to consider: </p>

<p class="p">With the introduction of touch-enabled Window 8 devices, touch is becoming part of the
expected desktop experience. In the past, UI5 statically detected whether the
running environment supports touch events. Then the assumption was made that only
touch (and not mouse) events need to be supported. This assumption became faulty
with the emerging of touch-enabled Windows 8 devices. The fact that touch events are
supported doesn&apos;t mean that user can&apos;t use other input device than touch. Therefore,
&quot;support touch&quot; is not equal to &quot;doesn&apos;t need mouse support&quot; anymore. For all these
reasons, we don&apos;t switch between touch and mouse - we now just support both of
them!</p>
<p class="p">The following figure shows how this is implemented:</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__fig_z1g_xcq_qn"><div class="figbody">
<img class="inline" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__image_tm4_pwk_4n" src="loio56d796e4026f463ab92c1ec10818f339_LowRes.png">
</div></div>
<p class="p">A desktop control is defined as a control that listens to mouse events, whereas a
mobile control listens to touch events. To ensure that all events can be received,
for mouse events touch simulation events are created and for touch events mouse
simulation events, respectively. So the UI Area, which acts as an event delegate,
receives the correct events. In detail:</p>
<div class="p"><ul class="ul" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__ul_oh4_vrb_4n">
<li class="li">When a mouse event is triggered for a desktop control, it&apos;s handed over to the UI area
directly.</li>
<li class="li">When a mouse event is triggered for a mobile control, a touch event is
simulated and handed over to the UI area.</li>
<li class="li">When a touch event is triggered for a mobile control, it&apos;s handed over to the UI area
directly. </li>
<li class="li">When a touch event is triggered for a desktop control, a mouse event is
simulated and handed over to the UI area.</li>
<li class="li">Some browsers send a delayed mouse event after a touch event, this is just
ignored.</li>
</ul>So it is ensured that all events can be handled and no event is triggered
twice.</div>
</section></div>
<div class="section"><section class="section" type="Support mouse and touch events together"><h2 class="section_title" style="font-size: 1.15em;">Support mouse and touch events together</h2>

<p class="p">Touch interfaces try to emulate mouse and click events obviously because touch interfaces need
to work with applications that have only interacted with mouse events before. This
means for a single tap on touch interfaces, the following events are fired in the
written order:</p>
<ol class="ol" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__ol_fmx_sry_mn">
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">touchstart</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">touchend</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">mousedown</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">mouseup</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">click</samp></li>
</ol>
<p class="p">If we support mouse and touch together, the event handler is called twice for a single tap
because there are touchstart and mousedown fired by the browser. Fortunately, we
have found a way to set a flag on the emulated mouse events from touch interfaces
and suppress those events when they reach the event handler.</p>
